# Entelechy

Entelechy is a Lisp-like programming language developed as a hobby. It transpiles to JavaScript and has support for some metalinguistic tools. There is also basic support for first-order logic.

Documentation is still in production.

A transpiler to C++ is also being developed (very early in production and will likely change to LLVM).
